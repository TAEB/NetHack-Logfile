=head1 NAME

NetHack::Logfile::Entry::32 - a finished game of NetHack 3.2.0 or later

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 FIELDS

=head2 score

=head2 dungeon

This is a string representing the dungeon, such as "The Gnomish MineS".
You may want L</dungeon_number>.

=head2 current_depth

=head2 deepest_depth

=head2 current_hp

=head2 maximum_hp

=head2 deaths

The number of times the character has died on the adventure. Usually this will
be 1, but could be fewer if the game did not end in death. It could be more if
the character was revived during the course of the adventure.

=head2 birth_date

A string (e.g. C<20090517>) representing the date that the game began.

=head2 end_date

A string (e.g. C<20090517>) representing the date that the game ended.

=head2 uid

The UNIX user ID of the game's human player.

=head2 role

The role of the character, e.g. C<archeologist>.

You may want the L<role_one> method which gives you the role's capital initial (e.g. C<A> for archeologist).

=head2 gender

The gender of the character, C<male> or C<female>.

You may want the L<gender_one> method which gives you the gender's capital
initial (e.g. C<F> for female).

=head2 player

The name of the player or character.

=head2 death

NetHack's description of how the game ended. Ideally it would be C<ascended>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 as_line

Renders this entry as a line in the logfile. This is constructed dynamically
(instead of being cached from parse time).

=head2 dungeon_number

Provides the dungeon I<number> instead of I<name>. Useful for doing your own
naming or other kind of indexing, I suppose.

=head2 role_one

The capital one-letter abbreviation of the character's role.

=head2 gender_one

The capital one-letter abbreviation of the character's role.

=cut
