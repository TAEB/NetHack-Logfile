=head1 NAME

NetHack::Logfile - Parse and create NetHack logfiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use NetHack::Logfile ':all';

    my @entries = read_logfile("logfile");
    @entries = sort { $b->score <=> $a->score } @entries;
    splice(@entries, 2000);
    write_logfile(\@entries, "high-scores");

    say $entries[0]->as_line;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an easy way to read NetHack logfiles. You can also create
logfiles.

This module's interface changed drastically from C<0.01> to C<1.00>.

Currently, NetHack versions 3.2.0 through 3.4.3 are supported. If you desire
support for an older version, please open up a ticket on rt.cpan.org with some
logfile entries for these older versions.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 read_logfile

Takes a file (default name: F<logfile>) and parses it as a logfile. If any IO
error occurs in reading the file, an exception is thrown. If any error occurs
in parsing a logline, an exception is thrown.

This returns entries of class L<NetHack::Logfile::Entry>. See that module for
more information.

=head2 parse_logline

Shortcut for L<NetHack::Logfile::Entry/new_from_line>.

=head2 write_logfile

Takes an arrayref of L<NetHack::Logfile::Entry> objects and a filename (default
name: F<logfile>). If any IO error occurs, it will throw an exception.

Returns no useful value.
